# Abstract Factory

While the factory pattern creates objects through inheritance, the abstract factory pattern creates objects through composition. Abstract factory provides an abstract type for creating a family of products (as opposed to a single product like factory). Subclasses then define how these products are produced.

Use whenever you have families of products and you want to make sure clients create products that belong together.
